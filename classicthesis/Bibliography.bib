Coordination among multiple robots and how different tasks are allocated to different system agents are being studied. The objective of this Systematic Literature Review (SLR) is to provide insights on the recent advancement in Multi-Robot Task Allocation (MRTA) problems emphasizing promising approaches for task allocation. In this study, we collected scientific papers from five different databases for MRTA. We outline the different approaches for task allocation algorithms, classifying them according to the methods, and emphasizing recent advances. In addition, we discuss the function of uncertainty in task allocation and typical coordination techniques utilized in task allocation to identify gaps in the literature and suggest the most promising ones.},

  abstract = {A cooperative game theory framework is proposed to solve multi-robot task allocation (MRTA) problems. In particular, a cooperative game is built to assess the performance of sets of robots and tasks so that the Shapley value of the game can be used to compute their average marginal contribution. This fact allows us to partition the initial MRTA problem into a set of smaller and simpler MRTA subproblems, which are formed by ranking and clustering robots and tasks according to their Shapley value. A large-scale simulation case study illustrates the benefits of the proposed scheme, which is assessed using a genetic algorithm (GA) as a baseline method. The results show that the game theoretical approach outperforms GA both in performance and computation time for a range of problem instances.}

The policy operates in a decentralized manner mapping raw sensor measurements to the robot’s steering commands without the need to construct a map of the environment. We also present a new metric called the Task Allocation Index (TAI), which measures the performance of a method that performs MRTA and navigation from end-to-end in performing MRTA. The policy was trained on a simulated gazebo environment. The centralized learning and decentralized execution paradigm was used for training the policy. The policy was evaluated quantitatively and visually. The simulation results showed the effectiveness of the proposed method deployed on multiple Turtlebot3 robots.},

  abstract       = {This paper deals with the concept of multi-robot task allocation, referring to the assignment of multiple robots to tasks such that an objective function is maximized. The performance of existing meta-heuristic methods worsens as the number of robots or tasks increases. To tackle this problem, a novel Markov decision process formulation for multi-robot task allocation is presented for reinforcement learning. The proposed formulation sequentially allocates robots to tasks to minimize the total time taken to complete them. Additionally, we propose a deep reinforcement learning method to find the best allocation schedule for each problem. Our method adopts the cross-attention mechanism to compute the preference of robots to tasks. The experimental results show that the proposed method finds better solutions than meta-heuristic methods, especially when solving large-scale allocation problems.},

In many real missions the tasks have associated deadlines. However, the literature only contains a few swarm methodologies, and thus response-threshold methods, tackling tasks with deadlines. Motivated by this fact, in this paper, we propose a new task allocation strategy inspired by response-threshold methods which deals with tasks with time deadlines, models stimuli using fuzzy sets and, in addition, in which each robot makes the decision about the best task to perform through the celebrated Bellman-Zadeh fuzzy optimization technique. An extensive number of simulations have been carried out in order to evaluate the quantitative performance of the swarm system based on the new approach. The results confirm that the proposed mathematical approach is able to model the evolution of the system when tasks with deadlines are under consideration. We have also observed competitive performance on a fleet of real robots, which corroborates the results derived from the simulations.}
