abstract = {Muti-Robot system is gaining attention and is one of the critical areas of research when it comes to robotics. Coordination among multiple robots and how different tasks are allocated to different system agents are being studied. The objective of this Systematic Literature Review (SLR) is to provide insights on the recent advancement in Multi-Robot Task Allocation (MRTA) problems emphasizing promising approaches for task allocation. In this study, we collected scientific papers from five different databases for MRTA. We outline the different approaches for task allocation algorithms, classifying them according to the methods, and emphasizing recent advances. In addition, we discuss the function of uncertainty in task allocation and typical coordination techniques utilized in task allocation to identify gaps in the literature and suggest the most promising ones.},

abstract = {A cooperative game theory framework is proposed to solve multi-robot task allocation (MRTA) problems. In particular, a cooperative game is built to assess the performance of sets of robots and tasks so that the Shapley value of the game can be used to compute their average marginal contribution. This fact allows us to partition the initial MRTA problem into a set of smaller and simpler MRTA subproblems, which are formed by ranking and clustering robots and tasks according to their Shapley value. A large-scale simulation case study illustrates the benefits of the proposed scheme, which is assessed using a genetic algorithm (GA) as a baseline method. The results show that the game theoretical approach outperforms GA both in performance and computation time for a range of problem instances.}

ABSTRACT = {In this paper, we present a novel deep reinforcement learning (DRL) based method that is used to perform multi-robot task allocation (MRTA) and navigation in an end-to-end fashion. The policy operates in a decentralized manner mapping raw sensor measurements to the robot’s steering commands without the need to construct a map of the environment. We also present a new metric called the Task Allocation Index (TAI), which measures the performance of a method that performs MRTA and navigation from end-to-end in performing MRTA. The policy was trained on a simulated gazebo environment. The centralized learning and decentralized execution paradigm was used for training the policy. The policy was evaluated quantitatively and visually. The simulation results showed the effectiveness of the proposed method deployed on multiple Turtlebot3 robots.},
